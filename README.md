# Education-Inequality

## Title: Project 2 (Inequality in Education Comparison)

### Description:
The purpose of this project is to determine whether school performance can be predicted by socioeconomic factors in the U.S. We will be taking a look at the average performance of a student on the ACT or SAT.

### Data:
There are two data sets being used. The primary data set is the Edgap data set from 2016 which includes about average ACT or SAT scores for schools and several socioeconomic characteristics (household income, unemployment, adult educational attainment, and family structure) of the school district.
Our second data set includes basic information about each school from the National Center for Education Statistics.

### Steps Taken to Prepare Data:
The steps taken to alter the data were that I first changed the data type for one of the variables, selected columns that were needed to create graphs and also renamed the columns. After that, I merged the two data sets together. Then I dropped the negative percentages for the percent_lunch column and also dropped all the non-quantitative values from the data sets that we could impute. Then I created a train test split.
