# Education-Inequality

## Title: Project 2 (Inequality in Education Comparison)

### Description:
The purpose of this project is to determine whether school performance can be predicted by socioeconomic factors in the U.S. We will be taking a look at the average performance of a student on the ACT or SAT.

### Data:
There are two data sets being used. The primary data set is the Edgap data set from 2016 which includes about average ACT or SAT scores for schools and several socioeconomic characteristics (household income, unemployment, adult educational attainment, and family structure) of the school district.
Our second data set includes basic information about each school from the National Center for Education Statistics.
